Your task is to explain the importance of prompt engineering for AI models like GPT. 

example:

Why is prompt engineering crucial for AI models like GPT?
Prompt engineering helps ensure that AI models like GPT generate accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses.

The responses must satisfy the rules given below:
1.The response should make sense to humans even when read without the given context.
2.The response should be fully answered from the given context.
3.Do no use phrases like 'provided context',etc in the question

context: In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements, driven by the development of large-scale language models such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). These models, trained on vast amounts of text data, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks such as language generation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, and question answering.
